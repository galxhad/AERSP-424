Welcome to my AERSP-424 repository for my homework assignment!

For the Grader:

    Q1: Run the code in Q1.cpp.
    Q2-5: Execute the code in Q2-5.cpp.
    Q6-7: Use Q6-7.cpp for these questions.
    Q8: Check the results in Q8.cpp.

Each file contains similar code structures, with the main function tailored to output results for each section. All the files in the repository runs all parts from 1 to 8 without any commented lines, providing a comprehensive output.
