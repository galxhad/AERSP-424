In Question 03, there are a few key challenges that could come up during the development of the program, particularly related to logic, synchronization, and timing. The code needs to be carefully structured so that multiple aircraft don’t try to communicate with the ATC at the same time. It also has to simulate a queue to ensure that not all incoming aircraft can immediately enter the traffic pattern doing so could overload the system with too many planes trying to land. One of the major issues in this scenario is the race condition, where the ATC is idle while aircraft are waiting to make contact in order to land or enter the traffic pattern. This issue often arises because some actions take time to complete. These delays can cause problems, like letting multiple aircraft into the traffic pattern at once or waking up the ATC at the wrong moment. Thread synchronization is another concern, as it could lead to issues where the traffic pattern isn't managed consistently or other parts of the simulation don’t run as they should.

The problem in Question 03 has real-world parallels, especially when considering how delays in certain processes—like waking up the ATC or checking the traffic pattern—can affect everything. Communicating with the ATC naturally takes time, since there’s a delay when waking up the ATC from its idle state after talking to another pilot. Pilots also need to ensure there’s no ongoing communication with the ATC before they try to wake it up. Similarly, there may be delays when checking the traffic pattern, and when an aircraft diverts to another airport, it will face further delays, having to go through the same process of contacting the ATC or entering a new traffic pattern at a different location.

One way to fix the race condition is to use a mutex, which ensures that only one aircraft can communicate with the ATC at a time. This will prevent multiple planes from accessing the ATC simultaneously and causing problems. The mutex will also help avoid race conditions when an aircraft updates the traffic pattern. To address thread synchronization issues, we can use a condition variable, which helps synchronize the aircraft’s landing attempt with the process of waking up the ATC. This ensures the aircraft only proceeds when the ATC is ready, keeping the sequence of events in the right order. To manage the timing, we can use the chrono library to simulate the delays caused by these actions, incorporating `std::this_thread::sleep_for()` to represent the time it takes for each task to complete.
